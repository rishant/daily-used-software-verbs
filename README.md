# MVP - Minimum Visible Product
 - MVP is a development technique in which a new product is introduced in the market with basic features.

# SIT - System Integration Testing
 - SIT Testing is performed to confirm whether the modules tested individually can work together to deliver the required functionality.

# SRE - Site reliability engineering 
 - SRE is a software engineering approach to IT operations. SRE teams use software as a tool to manage systems, solve problems, and automate operations tasks. ... SRE is a valuable practice when creating scalable and highly reliable software systems.

# DevOps - Development Operations
 - System of working that helps to keep development, IT operations, and quality assurance departments on the same page to make for better end-products and collaborations
 
# Domain - DNS
 - The address for a website as entered into the browser (ours is www.wholewhale.com!)

# Framework - 
 - Suite of programs used in website or software development. This lays the groundwork for the type of programming language used for your site or app development.

# FTP - File Transfer Protocol
 - Method of exchanging files from one computer to another. This is also how websites are uploaded to the Internet.

# Branching
 - The duplication of an object under review in source control so that the same code can be modified by more than one developer in parallel.

# Capacity Test
 - A test that is used to determine the maximum number of users a computer, server, or application can support just before failing.

# Configuration Management
 - A process for establishing and maintaining consistent settings of a system. These solutions also include SysAdmin tools for IT infrastructure automation (e.g. Chef, Puppet, etc.).

# Containerization
 - Resource isolation at the OS (rather than machine) level, usually (in UNIX-based systems) in user space. Isolated elements vary by containerization strategy and often include file system, disk quota, CPU and memory, I/O rate, root privileges, and network access. Much lighter-weight than machine-level virtualization and sufficient for many isolation requirement sets.

# Continuous Delivery
 - A software engineering approach in which continuous integration, automated testing, and automated deployment capabilities allow software to be developed and deployed rapidly, reliably, and repeatedly with minimal human intervention.

# Continuous Deployment
 - A software development practice in which every code change goes through the entire pipeline and is put into production automatically, resulting in many production deployments every day. It does everything that Continuous Delivery does, but the process is fully automated, and there’s no human intervention at all.

# Continuous Integration
 - A software development process where a branch of source code is rebuilt every time code is committed to the source control system. The process is often extended to include deployment, installation, and testing of applications in production environments.

# Continuous Quality
 - A principle that preaches the continuous quest for quality across the entire SDLC, starting from requirements definition, code development, testing, and operations. Another key area of focus for Continuous Quality is the application code pipeline orchestration. There are many opportunities to negatively impact the quality of an application when code is being manually moved across environments.

# Continuous Testing
 - The process of executing unattended automated tests as part of the software delivery pipeline across all environments to obtain immediate feedback on the quality of a code build.

# Fail Fast
 - A strategy in which you try something, it fails, feedback is delivered quickly, you adapt accordingly, and try again.

# Microservices Architecture
 - The practice of developing software as an interconnected system of several independent, modular services that communicate with each other.

# Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
 - A self-service computing, networking, and storage utility on-demand over a network.

# Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
 - Provides languages, libraries, services, and tools that allow developers to build and deploy applications in the cloud without worrying about underlying OS-level infrastructure

# Optimization - Process of improvment

# API - Application Programming Interface
 - API is the communication media WHERE how computers and applications communicate with one another.

# Application - Application know as App.
 - Application is a set of programs or features.

# CMS - Content Management System
 -  The program that you use to create and maintain your website’s content.

# Cookies
 - This is the data sent by an Internet server to a browser. Each time the browser accesses the same server, it sends the data back as a means of tracking how (and how often) it accesses the server. 
 - Example: This is why your home computer always knows your Netflix login

# Source Control
 - A system for storing, tracking, and managing changes to software. This is commonly done through a process of creating branches (copies for safely creating new features) off of the stable master version of the software and then merging stable feature branches back into the master version. This is also known as version control or revision control.

# Staging Environment
 - Used to test the newer version of your software before it’s moved to live production. Staging is meant to replicate as much of your live production environment as possible, giving you the best chance to catch any bugs before you release your software.

# CRM - Customer Relationship Management

# Technical Debt
 - A concept in programming that reflects the extra development work that arises when code that is easy to implement in the short run is used instead of applying the best overall solution.

# Unit Testing
 - A testing strategy in which the smallest unit of testable code is isolated from the rest of the software and tested to determine if it functions properly.

# TDD Test Driven Development 	
 - Also known as Red-Green-Refactor. 1) Write a failing unit test (red) 2) Code a first draft to turn the test green, keeping all other tests green). 3) “Refactor” to create an improved a final draft. TDD improves productivity by reducing misunderstood requirements, rework, and escaped errors.

# Scrum Master 	
 - A servant leader who helps Product Owner and Development Team perform better. Coaches & Facilitates. Removes impediments. Sometimes called the voice of common sense.
 - 
# Scrum Team 	
 - All three roles together make up the Scrum Team. Sometimes called the Whole Team
 
# Selected Product Backlog 	
 - The subset of (by definition top priority) PBIs that the Team reasonably believes it can complete during the Sprint. (Often mistakenly called the Sprint Backlog).

# Sprint 	
 - A timeboxed period for completing work. A Sprint consists of planning, doing and review, both of the results and of how the Team worked. Maximum timebox is 30 days. 2 weeks is common. All forecast work should be Done by the end of the Sprint.
# Sprint Backlog 	
 - The Selected Product Backlog, enriched with a technical concept and a task planning. The Sprint Backlog represents the Team’s concept for achieve the goal set during Sprint Planning 1.
# Sprint Contract 
 - The agreement between Product Owner and Team at the beginning of a sprint: Time (Sprint Duration), Cost (Team Composition), Quality (Definition of Done) and Scope (Selected Product Backlog). If the team should fail to deliver on any aspect, it should fail on Scope.
# Sprint Planning 	
 - Sprint planning addresses 2 questions: What and How. The meeting is divided in two halves, SP 1 and SP 2 for addressing these questions
# Sprint Planning 1 (SP1) 	
 - The Product Owner and Team agree on what will be developed during this sprint. The PO defines priorities, the Team estimates how much is doable. So both parties influence the final agreement: the Selected Product Backlog and the Sprint Goal
# Sprint Planning 2 (SP2) 	
 - The Team decides how to solve the probelm accepted in SP1. The result is a technical concept and a task planning, often in the form of a task board.
# Sprint Review 	
 - The Team and Product Owner come together to inspect and adapt the product, based on Done functionality. They will review what has and has not been completed, and reflect on how to change the Product Backlog before the next sprint planning

# Definition of Done (DoD)
 - An agreement on what ‘this Story is done,’ actually means. Helps assure Internal and External Quality for each Story. Often expressed as a checklist to be completed before submitting the Story to the P-O. The Definition of Done applies to individual Stories, not to Tasks or the overall release.

# Done (for a feature)
 - A binary state. Either a Story is completed according to the Definition of Done, or not.

# Estimate
 - A Team’s best guess at the size, complexity or time involved to convert a PBI into a piece of finished functionality. An estimate is not a commitment.

# Forecast
 - A Team’s best guess at how much finished functionality it can deliver by the end of a Sprint. The team is normally expected to respect all the terms of the Sprint Contract.

# Impediment
 - Anything which slows the team down or prevents someone from working. Although the Scrum Master is charged with removing impediments and all Scrum meetings provide regular opportunties to recognize them, impediments can be identified and eliminated at any time by anyone.

# Must
 - Absolutely required, or else! The Product Owner must attend Sprint Planning 1, otherwise the meeting cannot be held.

# PBI
 - Product Backlog Item

# Priority
 - Sequence – which item comes first, second, third, etc. The term priority is deprecated because a) it contains emotional overtones and b) two items could have the same priority, but must a have a unique place in line.

# Product Backlog
 - The single source of requirements for the product under development. It consists of functional and non-functional requirements. It is not used to plan work or define intermediate artifacts, like a specification, which have no value for the customer or user.

# Product Owner
 - A servant leader who guides the Development Team to produce customer visible value. Sometimes called the Voice of the Customer (or User), the role represents all interests outside the Development Team to the Team.
