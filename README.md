MVP - Minimum Visible Product
 - MVP is a development technique in which a new product is introduced in the market with basic features.

SIT - System Integration Testing
 - SIT Testing is performed to confirm whether the modules tested individually can work together to deliver the required functionality.

SRE - Site reliability engineering 
 - SRE is a software engineering approach to IT operations. SRE teams use software as a tool to manage systems, solve problems, and automate operations tasks. ... SRE is a valuable practice when creating scalable and highly reliable software systems.

DevOps - Development Operations
 - System of working that helps to keep development, IT operations, and quality assurance departments on the same page to make for better end-products and collaborations
 
Domain - DNS
 - The address for a website as entered into the browser (ours is www.wholewhale.com!)

Framework - 
 - Suite of programs used in website or software development. This lays the groundwork for the type of programming language used for your site or app development.

FTP - File Transfer Protocol
 - Method of exchanging files from one computer to another. This is also how websites are uploaded to the Internet.

Branching
 - The duplication of an object under review in source control so that the same code can be modified by more than one developer in parallel.

Capacity Test
 - A test that is used to determine the maximum number of users a computer, server, or application can support just before failing.

Configuration Management
 - A process for establishing and maintaining consistent settings of a system. These solutions also include SysAdmin tools for IT infrastructure automation (e.g. Chef, Puppet, etc.).

Containerization
 - Resource isolation at the OS (rather than machine) level, usually (in UNIX-based systems) in user space. Isolated elements vary by containerization strategy and often include file system, disk quota, CPU and memory, I/O rate, root privileges, and network access. Much lighter-weight than machine-level virtualization and sufficient for many isolation requirement sets.

Continuous Delivery
 - A software engineering approach in which continuous integration, automated testing, and automated deployment capabilities allow software to be developed and deployed rapidly, reliably, and repeatedly with minimal human intervention.

Continuous Deployment
 - A software development practice in which every code change goes through the entire pipeline and is put into production automatically, resulting in many production deployments every day. It does everything that Continuous Delivery does, but the process is fully automated, and there’s no human intervention at all.

Continuous Integration
 - A software development process where a branch of source code is rebuilt every time code is committed to the source control system. The process is often extended to include deployment, installation, and testing of applications in production environments.

Continuous Quality
 - A principle that preaches the continuous quest for quality across the entire SDLC, starting from requirements definition, code development, testing, and operations. Another key area of focus for Continuous Quality is the application code pipeline orchestration. There are many opportunities to negatively impact the quality of an application when code is being manually moved across environments.

Continuous Testing
 - The process of executing unattended automated tests as part of the software delivery pipeline across all environments to obtain immediate feedback on the quality of a code build.

Fail Fast
 - A strategy in which you try something, it fails, feedback is delivered quickly, you adapt accordingly, and try again.

Microservices Architecture
 - The practice of developing software as an interconnected system of several independent, modular services that communicate with each other.

Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
 - A self-service computing, networking, and storage utility on-demand over a network.

Optimization - Process of improvment

API - Application Programming Interface
 - API is the communication media WHERE how computers and applications communicate with one another.

Application - Application know as App.
 - Application is a set of programs or features.

CMS - Content Management System
 -  The program that you use to create and maintain your website’s content.

Cookies
 - This is the data sent by an Internet server to a browser. Each time the browser accesses the same server, it sends the data back as a means of tracking how (and how often) it accesses the server. 
 - Example: This is why your home computer always knows your Netflix login

CRM - Customer Relationship Management
